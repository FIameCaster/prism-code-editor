import "../../../components/editor/Folding.astro"
import "../../../css/editor-theme.css"

This library support code folding, but only for read-only editors. All editors on this page are therefore read-only. Code folding for writable editors is significantly more complex and therefore not implemented.

## Try it

```html editor readOnly
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Code folding demo</title>
	<style>
		.prism-code-editor {
			font-size: 0.875rem;
			line-height: 1.5;
			height: 50em;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>
		Prism code editor is awesome
	</h1>
	<div id="editor"></div>
	<script type="module">
		import { createEditor } from "prism-code-editor"

		/**
		 * You can fold comments too!
		 */
		const editor = createEditor(
			"#editor",
			{
				language: "javascript",
				value: "const foo = 'bar'"
			}
		)
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Providers

By default, the `readOnlyCodeFolding` extension won't fold any ranges. You need to pass folding range providers to the extension when it's created.

```js editor readOnly
import {
	readOnlyCodeFolding,
	markdownFolding,
	blockCommentFolding,
	bracketFolding,
	tagFolding
} from "prism-code-editor/code-folding"
import "prism-code-editor/code-folding.css"

editor.addExtensions(
	readOnlyCodeFolding(
		bracketFolding,
		tagFolding,
		markdownFolding,
		blockCommentFolding
	)
)
```

There are currently 4 providers you can import:

- [`bracketFolding(){:js}`](/api-reference/code-folding/f-bracketfolding) adds folding to round-, square-, and curly brackets.
- [`tagFolding(){:js}`](/api-reference/code-folding/f-tagfolding) adds folding to XML tags.
- [`blockCommentFolding(){:js}`](/api-reference/code-folding/f-blockcommentfolding) adds folding to block comments.
- [`markdownFolding(){:js}`](/api-reference/code-folding/f-markdownfolding) adds folding to headings and code blocks in markdown.

### Adding your own

You can easily create your own [`FoldingRangeProvier{:js}`](/api-reference/code-folding/t-foldingrangeprovider). The providers are called with the current editor and should return an array of foldable ranges. These ranges should span multiple lines.

```ts editor readOnly
import {
	readOnlyCodeFolding,
	FoldingRangeProvider
} from "prism-code-editor/code-folding"

const myProvider: FoldingRangeProvider = editor => {
	return [[5, 20], [10, 15]]
}

editor.addExtensions(
	readOnlyCodeFolding(myProvider)
)
```
