<MountEditors />

## Motivation

There are multiple fully featured code editors for the web such as Monaco, Ace and CodeMirror. While these are awesome, they have a large footprint and are likely overkill for code examples, forms, playgrounds, or anywhere you won't display large documents.

All code examples shown in this documentation use editors created by this library, because why not!

## Installation

`prism-code-editor` is a package published on NPM. Install it with a package manager.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
```bash editor
npm install prism-code-editor
```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
```bash editor
pnpm add prism-code-editor
```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
```bash editor
yarn add prism-code-editor
```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic usage

This library provides multiple ways to create editors. Perhaps the easiest is to use one of the 3 different setups: [`minimalEditor(){:js}`](/api-reference/setups/f-minimaleditor), [`basicEditor(){:js}`](/api-reference/setups/f-basiceditor), or [`readOnlyEditor(){:js}`](/api-reference/setups/f-readonlyeditor). These will automatically import the necessary styles and scope them with a shadow root, add various extensions, and import all language specific behavior. There are multiple downsides to using the setups, but they're a viable option for anyone who wants an editor that works well out of the box.

```js editor
import { basicEditor } from "prism-code-editor/setups"
// Importing Prism grammars
import "prism-code-editor/prism/languages/markup"

const editor = basicEditor(
	"#editor",
	{
		language: "html",
		theme: "github-dark",
	},
	() => console.log("mounted"),
)
```

<Aside type="note">
	You might want to add `display: grid{:css}` to your container element.
</Aside>

## Configuration

The second argument (type [`EditorOptions{:js}`](/api-reference/index/types/editoroptions)) to the setups allows some basic configuration of the created editor. Below is a list of the allowed properties.

- `language`: Language used for syntax highlighting. If the language doesn't have a registered Prism grammar, syntax highlighting will be disabled. Defaults to `text`.
- `tabSize`: Tab size used for indentation. Defaults to `2`.
- `insertSpaces`: Whether the editor should insert spaces for indentation. Defaults to `true`. Requires the `defaultCommands(){:js}` extension to work.
- `lineNumbers`: Whether line numbers should be shown. Defaults to `true`.
- `readOnly`: Whether the editor should be read only. Defaults to `false`.
- `wordWrap`: Whether the editor should have word wrap. Defaults to `false`.
- `value`: Initial value to display in the editor.
- `rtl`: Whether the editor uses right to left directionality. Defaults to `false`. Requires extra CSS from `prism-code-editor/rtl-layout.css` to work unless the setups are used.
- `class`: Additional classes for the root container. Useful to style individual editors. `.prism-code-editor{:selector}` can be used to style all editors.
- `onUpdate`: Function called after the editor updates.
- `onSelectionChange`: Function called when the editor's selection changes.
- `onTokenize`: Function called before the tokens are stringified to HTML.

The setups also take `theme` as an option to specify which theme to load.

## Events

There are three different events both you and extensions can listen to: `tokenize`, `update` and `selectionChange`.

- `tokenize` handlers run after the code is tokenized, which makes it possible to change the tokens before the HTML string is created.
- `update` handlers run after the syntax highlighted DOM has been updated.
- `selectionChange` handlers run right after `update` handlers or when the user changes the selection.

## Web components

The library includes a custom element wrapper for each of the 3 setups you can import.

```ts editor
import { addBasicEditor, PrismEditorElement } from "prism-code-editor/web-component"

// Adds a web component with the specified name
addBasicEditor("prism-editor")

const editorElement = document.querySelector<PrismEditorElement>("prism-editor")

// Add a listener for when the editor finishes loading
editorElement.addEventListener("ready", () => console.log("ready"))

// The editor can be accessed from the element
console.log(editorElement.editor)
```

This is how the web component could be used:

```html editor
<style>
	prism-editor {
		display: grid;
	}
</style>
<prism-editor
	language="javascript"
	theme="vs-code-dark"
	tab-size="4"
	line-numbers
	insert-spaces
	word-wrap
>
	The editors initial code goes here
</prism-editor>
```

### Attributes

Attributes include `language`, `theme`, `tab-size`, `line-numbers`, `word-wrap`, `readonly`, `insert-spaces`, and `rtl`. There are also writable properties for these attributes on the element.
