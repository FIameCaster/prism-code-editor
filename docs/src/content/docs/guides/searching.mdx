The `prism-code-editor/search` entry point exports extensions for searching editors and highlighting and replacing the matches. On this page, you can view the different extensions for searching.

## Search extensions

### `showInvisibles`

[`showInvisibles(){:js}`](/api-reference/search/f-showinvisibles) highlights spaces and tabs in the editor. Highlighting all tabs and spaces in an editor comes with a significant performance hit which is why only those that are selected will be highlighted by default, but they can be shown at all times by passing `true` to the extension.

Styles from `prism-code-editor/invisibles.css` are required by the extension. The default color of these highlights works well for most dark themes, but light themes should use the CSS variable `--pce-invisibles{:css}` to override the color.

```ts editor
import { showInvisibles } from "prism-code-editor/search"
import "prism-code-editor/invisibles.css"

editor.addExtensions(showInvisibles())
```

### `highlightSelectionMatches`

[`highlightSelectionMatches(){:js}`](/api-reference/search/f-highlightselectionmatches) is an extension that highlights other instances of the current selection. This extension is also present on all editors on this website. The CSS variable `--editor__bg-selection-match{:css}` can be used to set the background of the matches. All included themes assign this variable.

```ts editor
import { highlightSelectionMatches } from "prism-code-editor/search"

editor.addExtensions(highlightSelectionMatches())
```

### `highlightCurrentWord`

[`highlightCurrentWord(){:js}`](/api-reference/search/f-highlightcurrentword) highlights instances of the word the cursor is currently on. You can define a filter function to control what gets highlighted. I.e. in JavaScript, you may want to exclude any words that start inside a string, comment, keyword, or regex token. The CSS selector `.word-matches span{:selector}` can be used to style the matches. All included themes add a background to this selector.

```ts editor
import { highlightCurrentWord } from "prism-code-editor/search"
import { getClosestToken } from "prism-code-editor/utils"

const selector = ".string, .comment, .keyword, .regex"

editor.addExtensions(
	highlightCurrentWord(start => !getClosestToken(editor, selector, 0, 0, start))
)
```

The editor above has this extension added with the filter function shown.

## Search widget

This is easily the most complex extension on this page. [`searchWidget(){:js}`](/api-reference/search/f-searchwidget) adds a widget to the editor allowing users to search the editor with strings or regular expressions and replace the matches.

The default styles for the widget can be imported from `prism-code-editor/search.css`. If you're dissatisfied with these styles, you can import your own instead.

The widget can be opened with Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac). Alternatively, you can use the button below to try it on mobile.

<Button>Open widget</Button>

```ts editor
import { searchWidget } from "prism-code-editor/search"
import "prism-code-editor/search.css"

editor.addExtensions(searchWidget())
```

## APIs

If you want to create your own extensions that do searching, use [`createSearchAPI(){:js}`](/api-reference/search/api/f-createsearchapi) or [`createReplaceAPI(){:js}`](/api-reference/search/api/f-createreplaceapi) exported from `prism-code-editor/search/api`.
