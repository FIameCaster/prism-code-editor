This page will tell you which configuration options are available for the rehype plugin and marked extension.

## Properties

### `editorsOnly`

When true, code blocks without the `editor` property are ignored, but you can still create code blocks by adding the `editor=false` meta property. This is useful if you're using another plugin to highlight code blocks.

### `defaultEditorProps`

Default properties for fenced code blocks with the `editor` meta property. Useful to avoid repeating the same meta properties on every code block.

### `defaultCodeBlockProps`

Default properties for fenced code blocks without the `editor` meta property, or with `editor=false`. Useful to avoid repeating the same meta properties on every code block.

### `customRenderer`

Method that allows you to wrap the default render function or completely override it. This method gets called with the following arguments:

- `props: CodeBlockProps{:ts}`: Props used to render the editor or code block.
- `defaultRenderer: (props: CodeBlockProps) => string{:ts}`: The default render function.
- `isEditor: boolean{:ts}`: Whether or not an editor is being rendered.

The [features page](/markdown-plugins/features#custom-render-function) shows an example.

### `inline`

Options for highlighting inline code between backticks. If this option is omitted, inline highlighting will be disabled. The [features page](/markdown-plugins/features#inline-highlighting) explains this feature in more detail.

### `silenceWarnings`

These plugins will warn you when a code block has a language without a registered grammar. Set this option to `true` to disable the warnings.
