## What is Prism code editor

Prism code editor is a lightweight code editor component for the web. There are multiple fully featured code editors for the web such as Monaco, Ace and CodeMirror. While these are awesome, they have a large footprint and are likely overkill for many use cases. Prism code editor is designed to be used in documentation, demos, forms, playgrounds, or anywhere you won't need to display huge documents.

## How to use these docs

Almost every code block in these docs is an editor created with this library, because why not! The guides tell you how to use the library and how to solve some common problems. Refer to the API reference for detailed descriptions of functions, which entry points exist, and what they export. Lastly, the [playground](/playground) allows you to try the editor with all supported languages and themes.
